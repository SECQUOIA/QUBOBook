# QUBOBook

This JupyterBook is a result of the effort to make the knowledge and algorithms surrounding optimization more accessible to the public, a core value of the SECQUOIA research group at Purdue University. The contents were adapted from Professor David E. Bernal Neira's QuiPML course taught at CMU.
